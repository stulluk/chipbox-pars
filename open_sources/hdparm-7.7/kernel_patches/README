The new "libata" SATA/IDE drivers in the Linux-2.6.xx kerrnels
do not yet support use of hdparm on ATAPI devices.

This directory includes two kernel patches that can
be applied together (in sequence) to add support to
the kernel for using hdparm with ATAPI (CD/DVD/tape) drives.

	01_libata_cmd_len_check.patch
	02_libata_atapi_ata16.patch

Both of these are required for any kernel prior to 2.6.22,
and only the second one should be needed with later kernels.

There is also another patch in this directory to enable "libata"
to deal with drives that have been set for "power-up in standby"
(eg. using "hdparm -s1").  Without this patch, such drives become
expensive paperweights, at least until booted under a kernel
that has had the patch applied.  This patch is needed for all
kernels prior to 2.6.22, but not with 2.6.22 or later.

	03_libata_standby_spinup.patch

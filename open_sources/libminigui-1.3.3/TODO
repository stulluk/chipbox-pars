The features will be in MiniGUI version 2.0.x.
=============================================

1. A good architecture to support clients/server-based MiniGUI.
   We need to rewrite the underlay code of MiniGUI-Lite.

   The MiniGUI version 2.0.x can be built to one of the following 
   run-time versions:

        - MiniGUI-Standalone:   Standalone version.
        - MiniGUI-Threads:      Threads version.
        - MiniGUI-Complete:     A complete clients/server-based version.

2. Support windows/controls layout theme.

3. Add C++ class library for MiniGUI in MiniGUI Foundation Classes 
   library (another MFC).

4. Runing Mesa3D/OpenGL on MiniGUI.

5. Resource management. Dynamically load resources, include strings, 
   menus, and dialog box templates.
